Hi, I’m @ecosensors
- I’m interested in building IoT applicatiom with LoRaWAN devises for agriculture
- I’m currently working on a LoRaWAN solution with Waterproof tempearture sensors (DS18B20) to monitor temperature of the buds that emerge during the spring frost, to allow operators to be immediately alarmed and to take the necessary action to protect their crops [Read more (french)](https://eco-sensors.ch/smart-bud/). I am also working with similar PCB and WATERMARK sensors to monitor the water content in the soil of crops to allow operator to control the irrigation in order to save on the cost of pumping and increase the operator's yield [Read more (french)](https://eco-sensors.ch/smart-irrigation/). Finally, I developed LoRaWAN Meteo station for local measures, close to the crops [Read more (french)](https://eco-sensors.ch/meteo/).

[Here](https://github.com/ecosensors/ecosensors/wiki/List-of-the-materials-(LoRaWAN-Gateways-and-nodes)) is a reusme and a not-exhaustive list of my LoRaWAN structure and board componment.
