Hi, I’m @ecosensors
- I’m interested in building IoT applicatiom with LoRaWAN devises for agriculture
- I’m currently working on sensors to monitor temperature of the buds that emerge during the spring frost, to allow operators to be immediately alarmed and to take the necessary action to protect their crops [Read more (french)](https://eco-sensors.ch/smart-bud/). I am also working on similar PCB to monitor the water content in the soil of crops to allow operator to control the irrigation in order to save on the cost of pumping and increase the operator's yield [Read more (french)](https://eco-sensors.ch/smart-irrigation/). Finally, I developed LoRaWAN Meteo station [Read more (french)](https://eco-sensors.ch/meteo/)
