- 👋 Hi, I’m @ecosensors
- 👀 I’m interested in building IoT applicatiom with LoRaWAN devises for agriculture
- 🌱 I’m currently working on sensors to monitor temperature of the buds that emerge during the spring frost, to allow operators to be immediately alarmed and to take the necessary measures to protect their crops. I am also working on similar sensors to monitor the water content in the soil of crops to allow operator to control the irrigation in order to save on the cost of pumping and increase the operator's yield.
